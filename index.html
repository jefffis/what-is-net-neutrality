		<p>Dear anyone who doesn&rsquo;t really know what Net Neutrality is,</p>
		<h1>Let&rsquo;s break down what it is and what it is not. Simple.</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>It is:</strong>
			unrestricted access to all content on the internet for all people; black, white, hispanic, rich, poor, smart, less-smart, techy, non-techy, nerd, jock, romantic, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>It is not:</strong>
			government regulation of access to content on the internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>It is:</strong>
			equally important for everyone; be them Democrat, Republican, Independent, indifferent, insipid, intolerant, or introvert.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>It is not:</strong>
			anything about Obama, Obamacare, or any Obama-related issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>It is:</strong>
			an ability for the small guy to take the big guy down.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>It is not:</strong>
			anything but an attempt by large corporations to squeeze even more money out of us.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			It is something we should all understand. <strong>It WILL affect us all; and most likely all of mankind;</strong> that&rsquo;s how important the free internet is.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Net Neutrality fails, ISPs <strong>(like Comcast, Verizon, and Time Warner, amongst others)</strong> will make their own rules. Think you pay a lot for spotty internet access now? This is nothing compared to what will happen if they start charging for access to certain website content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do you like Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram? Well, without Net Neutrality, we wouldn&rsquo;t know what they are, and we won&rsquo;t meet the next one. Ever.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, please, leave your partisan issues at the door, and think about whether you benefit from free access to any website you wish; or whether you think it&rsquo;s okay for your internet provider to tell you which ones are okay to visit.
		</p>
		<p micro>
			Thanks,<br>
			A few hundred million concerned citizens
		</p>
